# todosList
The project is a simple toDo's list website where user can schedule his time by adding the things he needs to do
The tech stack I used here are HTML5, Bootstrap and JavaScript as the UserInterface is much simpler and logical coding is also bit smaller.
In near future I would like to add reminder tab in website which will send the reminder alert to user mobile about the task.
